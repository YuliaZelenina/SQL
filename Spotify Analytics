--The data was downloaded from Kaggle
--Then I created a table to which I imported the data
--And performed analytics on the data using SQL

--#1 what's the popularity of each track from greatest to smallest
SELECT popularity, track_name, artist_name
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY 1 desc;


--#2 What artist has more than 1 popular song
SELECT DISTINCT artist_name, count(track_name) as popular_songs
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name
HAVING popular_songs > 1
ORDER BY 2 desc;


--#3 What is the average danceability by artist?
SELECT DISTINCT artist_name, round(avg(danceability), 3) as avg
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name
ORDER BY 1 ASC;


--#4 Who are the top 10 artists based on popularity?
SELECT DISTINCT artist_name, max(popularity) as popularity
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name
ORDER BY 2 desc
LIMIT 10;


--#5 What artist released the longest song?
SELECT DISTINCT artist_name, max(duration_ms) as max_duration
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata;
