--In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data. 

--#1 How many orders were placed in January?
SELECT count(orderID)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales;

--#2 How many of those orders were for an iPhone?
SELECT count(orderID)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE Product = 'iPhone';

--#3 Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.
SELECT acctnum
FROM BIT_DB.customers c
JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales fs
ON c.order_id = fs.orderID;


--#4 Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?
-- 0.001 sec
SELECT DISTINCT product, price
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE price = (select min(price) from BIT_DB.JanSales);

--0.005 sec
SELECT DISTINCT product, price
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
order by 2 ASC
LIMIT 1;


--#5 What is the total revenue for each product sold in January? 
SELECT product, round(sum(quantity)*price, 2) as revenue
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY product;


--#6 Which products were sold in February at *548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, 
--how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
SELECT product, sum(quantity) as quantity, round(sum(quantity)*price, 2) as revenue
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101';


--#7 How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, 
--what was the average amount spent for those customers?
SELECT count(c.order_id), round(avg(price*quantity),2)
FROM BIT_DB.customers c
JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales fs
